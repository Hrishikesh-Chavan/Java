 if you want to use static method in program first you have to create method name then its return type then static and then 
 access modifier(optional).
 you can use static method directly in main method.
 you can use instance varible in static method by making varible as static var.

 if you want non static method first you have to type method name then return type then access modifier(optional).
 you can access method name in main method by creating obj of class then using obj.method name 

 if you want to use a variable in any methods then you can make this varible as instance varible(global varible/var of class).
